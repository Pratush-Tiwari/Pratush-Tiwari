Hi, I’m Pratush Tiwari.
I am a full-stack developer experienced in building scalable, production-ready applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and AWS. My work spans end-to-end product development, including architecture design, performance optimization, automation workflows, and deployment pipelines.

I have a strong inclination toward problem solving, system design, and creating solutions that are both efficient and maintainable. I actively explore new technologies, particularly in AI and backend engineering, to broaden my technical depth and contribute to impactful projects.

For collaboration or opportunities, you can reach me at pratushtiwari.iitkgp@gmail.com
